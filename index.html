				<h2>Establishing the Grid</h2>
				<article class="third">
					<h4>The Core</h3>
					<p>The main concept for Ro3g was a light-weight grid system built upon the core concept beautiful spacing. In design Their are several rules throughn around to assist us with this. Coming from a Film &amp; Photography background I tend to lean on the "<a href="" title"">Rule of Thirds</a>"</p>
				</article>
				<article class="third">
       					<h4>Rule of Thirds</h3>
					<p>The rule of thirds is everywhere, is all around us you just do not realize it. In Film it steams from the concept that things are more believeable in series of threes. Don't beilieve me, rewatch your favorite movie and pay attention to all the little details. In Framing or how it relates to design, this relates to dividing your screen in by 3 both horizontaly and vertically. What is does is give you nine equalt boxes to use when spacing and aligning the elements of your piece.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="third">
       					<h4>12 Columns</h3>
					<p>So why did we go wth a 12 Column grid. Simple it is ompletely divisible by three, further more you can divide it in half and get 6 columns for the Tablet sceen and still be divisible by three. Take it one step further and divide it once more by three to get the Mobile sceen in Landscape mode, yet still maintain the division of three. You begin to see the real power of a 12 column grid.</p>

				<h2>Scratching the Surface</h2>
				<article class="third">
					<h4>Columns</h3>
					<p>Keeping in mind the Rule of thirds. When choicing our column size yet again allows us to further control our content. We chase a size that was divisible by three once more, each column size across all platforms is evenly divisible by three. This allows for extremely detailed control over our content </p>
				</article>
				<article class="third">
					<h4>24px Gutter?</h3>
					<p>Aside from 24 also being divisisible by three it also falls on the typographic scale which gives direct relation to our horizontal spacing. This allows for a truly symbiotic relationship between both vertical and horizontal spacing of content.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="third">
					<h4>The Horizontal</h3>
					<p>The horizontal grid is a little different, kown as the "Baseline Grid" you need to limit yourself to something that works with the scale of your typography. With this in mind rather than restric you to the normal static 18px that mst Baselines set up for a utter to small fontsize for screens with 12px. We opted to leave it flexabile by providing a 6px Baseline grid which is what the typography scale is based on and guess what is disible by three. We also provided the means to hit that 24px break to match the vertical gutter, and because its the default setup that comes with the system.</p>

				<h2>The Code</h2>
				<article class="third">
					<h4>Units</h3>
					<p>Our grid is unique in that it is based on the common units we use in designing for the web rather than individual columns. We rarely need soemthing under 3 columns or over 9 columns when plaing content to fit the Rule of thirds. This is why we chose to stick with only a few unit <a href="">classes</a> to best control this. By using divisons rather than column counts we reduce the size of the grid to less than half the normal grid system. Thus giving us only 5 units "fourth, thrid, half, two-thirds, three-fourths"</p>
				</article>
				<article class="third">
 					<h4>Responsive</h3>
					<p>We also provide a few classes to assist with the control of our units for the small screens. The way our system works rather than scale down your content we leave alone or scale it up. How you ask. Alot of times the larger sreens have content that might not be 100% needed for th esite to function. We provide the means to hid this content on certain devices, which in turn frees up space thus allows us to turn fourth into a third or a thrid into a half. In fact the only content the gets scaled down is the larger content units that are at least half the screen or more.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="third">
					<h4>Implimentaion</h3>
					<p>The way our grid is implemented could not be easier. First we require less Clearfix hacks by nature only requiring one for each container used. We alos rely on the multiple class heiarchy to handle alot of the heavy lifting. For instance by specifing a row using the thirds class we hav thrre units across the screen. by adding the class of mobile to just one of these will in-turn hide that block on the tablet device giving use more space to ues the remaing two to each fill half the screen. We can also use a tablet class to hide something from mobile or combine the two to hide it from both. Extemely powerful control of your content.</p>
